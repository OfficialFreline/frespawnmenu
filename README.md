# FreSpawnMenu
> This addon allows you to completely replace the standard SpawnMenu from Garry's Mod with a new one. `There is no single interface layout, because it is completely customized visually through the game config - you choose what it should be`.
>
> You can also use [Steam Workshop for easy installation](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2613708971)

## FatedUI 
The FreSpawnMenu can be used with a third-party library. Thanks to this, he gets a few new opportunities. Therefore, we recommend [installing FatedUI](https://github.com/darkfated)

## What opportunities does it have ❤️
> **General view**
> The menu has a minimalistic design
> ![image](https://github.com/darkfated/FreSpawnmenu/assets/49955245/eba8b1cc-deab-49c8-8267-58f27a5f486d)

> **Tabs**
> You can rename, hide tabs, and conveniently switch between them

> **Conservation**
> When you exit the game, the last open tab and the tool you used are saved. At the next opening, everything will remain in its place. Nothing else is reset, and you don't have to click on the items from the beginning.

> **ContextMenu**
> There is no need to go into Context Menu anymore. Everything from there is in FreSpawnMenu: the top panel and the list of game icons of addons (for example Player Model).

> **Tools**
> Rethinking the vision of the Tool-part

> Added favorite tools

> **Fast interaction**
> Universal clicks are scattered throughout the interface (via the middle mouse button and the right one). This allows you to perform actions that are usually done with a lot of clicks in one click. `Example: when you click on the tool categories button with the middle mouse button, a list of all your favorite tools opens at once`.

> **Customization**
> There is a separate tool in the game, by selecting which you get to the settings menu. Here it is possible to change FreSpawnMenu beyond `recognition`.

> An example of a radical change in settings

> **4K resolution**
> People with a high screen resolution suffer from the fact that the elements of the standard menu are too small. The FreSpawnMenu has `adaptive resolution`.

> **Dark theme**
> The standard menu is available only in white colors. Not everyone is comfortable with this.

**And much more!**
